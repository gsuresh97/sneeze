Need to install Django, Django Rest Framework, MongoDB, and pymongo


MongoDB Schema
db: db
	collection: _____
		[{
			loc: [long, lat],
			file_path: "path",
			user: "user_name",
			time: time

		}]

To get the location in React Native, use getCurrentPosition() in Geolocation API. This returns a Position object which has a Coordinates member. Use this in your API calls.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Coordinates

The MongoDB database for this is stored at /sneeze/db. To start the database, execute mongod --dbpath <PATH_TO_SNEEZE>/db
